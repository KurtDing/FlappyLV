# FlappyLV
Small game like flappy bird, made by Labview front panel controllers.  
Collision detected by AABB method, the possible objects are around 3~5 so the screen updates smoothly.

The object we controlled and the flying brick are also front panel controller. They are customized boolean LED indicator.  
Way to creat customize control is put a control on FP and choose it, then click the menu item as picture below shows.  
New window will pop out, and I can drag picture from file explore to FP to modify the controller.  
Looks any format pictures are acceptable, also GIF pictures.  
The animation of GIF can display on customized control, but the first frame is always displayed in my case.
